# CZ3001 Lab 4

Lab by itself is simple but holy shit debugging instructions written in hex and without breakpoints (maybe it exists idk) gave me ass cancer. Bloody lab took way longer to complete than it should have. The [OPCode converter](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/smitha/OPCoder/OPCoder/converter.html) will save you a ton of time for this lab instead of manually calculating the instruction.
